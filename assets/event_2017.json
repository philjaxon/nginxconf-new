It was updated for IoT use cases in 2013 and has since become one of the top protocols of choice for many IoT deployments. With the increased production IoT deployments and the staggering amount of devices connecting to MQTT brokers, the demand for a high performant load balancer with advanced functionality is more than ever a critical factor to the success of their implementation.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will give a detailed overview of the problem we set out to solve for HiveMQ around security and load balancing. To improve IoT security, it is best practice to use TLS to encrypt the MQTT data passing between clients and upstream servers. We will look in depth at how NGINX Plus can be used to easily offload this process facilitating the encrypted transport. We will look at how an additional layer of security using client certificate authentication and a powerful scripting language called nginScript can be used to harden an MQTT deployment and in turn ensuring that messages are received are from a trusted and genuine device. \r\n\r\nLastly, we set out to solve an issue of application persistence in an internet facing production deployment. In many cases IoT devices are connecting over the internet and building a session based on their IP address becomes unreliable, for this the session is identified by the clientId provided by the client on connection establishment. We will showcase how nginScript is used to extract this unique client identifier from the initial connection passing through NGINX Plus and in turn is used to build a sticky session to the backend server.\r\n\r\nThis solution has been implemented and in turn helped solve issues around security hardening, offloading of TLS encryption of the MQTT transport and has allowed the implantation of a platform agnostic approach to proxying and load balancing within the applications infrastructure.","speakers":[{"_id":"5910e52e9864d25551000211","full_name":"Liam Crilly","first_name":"Liam","last_name":"Crilly","company":"NGINX, Inc.","job_title":"Director of Product Management","headline":"Director of Product Management at NGINX, Inc.","location":null,"url":null,"twitter_username":"nginx","created_at":"2017-05-08T14:37:50-07:00","updated_at":"2017-07-18T11:46:11-07:00","bio":"Liam Crilly, Director of Product Management at NGINX, Inc.,  has 20 years experience in the Internet industry.

To be placed on a list for future modules-related training, please email bob.worobec@nginx.com*\r\n\r\n**Developing NGINX Modules** is a hands-on class that will give you the foundation you need to begin extending NGINX functionality with NGINX modules. The class will begin with a discussion of when and why a new NGINX module might be the best solution for you. We'll then guide you through the development process from the point of view of a first time developer: obstacles encountered and how they were overcome, with particular attention to the sites, blogs, and queries that were most helpful. Next, you'll dive into NGINX internals \u2013 the code that is NGINX. You'll get an architectural overview, deep dives into how connections are handled, data types and structures, memory, module structure, and NGINX coding best-practices. You'll then write a simple hello_world module, exploring the build process, dynamic vs static modules, and how to specify its directives. You'll then write and execute tests for your module. Following the hello_world module, you'll write simple access, header filter, and body filter modules. We'll discuss the NGINX Certified Module program, best practices for module development, and the resources we've made available to you. The class wraps up with a panel discussion with our instructors \u2013 Valentin Bartenev, Roman Arutyunyan, and Aidan Carson.\r\n\r\n**Objectives**\r\nAfter completing this class you will be able to:\r\n- Describe NGINX internal architecture\r\n- Explain core aspects of NGINX code in the context of module development\r\n- Describe requirements for successful NGINX modules\r\n- Get the resources you need to begin module development\r\n- Create a simple content module\r\n- Create a simple access module\r\n- Create a simple header filter module\r\n- Create a simple body filter module\r\n\r\n**Audience**\r\nDeveloping NGINX Modules is for architects and developers who are interested in extending NGINX core functionality for specific business purposes.\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nDeveloping NGINX Modules is intended for developers and advanced administrators with prior development experience. C/C++ and systems programing is recommended. Basic knowledge of configuring, troubleshooting and administering NGINX is highly advised.

Through lecture and hands-on activities you implement NGINX as a web server, load balancer, and as a reverse proxy. You'll secure your site with SSL/TLS, improve site performance with caching and compression. And you'll learn how to monitor and troubleshoot your site with live activity monitoring, custom logging, and dynamic server configuration. Whether you are new to NGINX, starting your first NGINX project, or refining your DevOps skills, NGINX Core will give you a grounding you can build on. NGINX Core is also your gateway to more advanced training topics like Microservices Network Architectures with NGINX, and others.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nIf you're new to NGINX, NGINX Core is the place to start. If you\u2019re self-taught, or have some working experience with NGINX, NGINX Core will help you complete your understanding of NGINX. In NGINX Core, you will implement the most common use cases for NGINX - web server, proxy server, and load balancer - in a secure, scalable way. As you do, you'll build a solid foundation for moving on to advanced topics, including more complex security considerations and microservices implementation and architecture.\r\n\r\nNGINX Core combines lecture, instructor demos, and hands-on activities to expose participants to NGINX. Participants will be given a pre-configured, personal training environment for class activities. Each lecture and instructor demo in NGINX Core will be followed by hands-on activities in which participants will implement the use case in question. For example, following the lesson on Serving Static Content, participants will implement a basic web server that serves static content in their training environment. As participants complete Proxying Connections, they\u2019ll be adding a simple proxy server scenario to their implementation. In later modules they\u2019ll add security (HTTPS), implement variables and maps, route connections, rewrite and redirect requests, implement a variety of load balancing models, and configure caching.\r\n\r\n**Objectives**\r\n- Serve static content\r\n- Proxy connections to upstream servers\r\n- Configure and customize Logging\r\n- Configure HTTPS & Site Security\r\n- Use Variables in Rewrites, Routing, and Maps\r\n- Route Connections\r\n- Configure Load Balancing for HTTP using the weighted Round Robin, Least Time, Least Connections, Hash, and IP Hash methods\r\n- Enable Live Activity Monitoring of servers and upstreams\r\n- Implement & Manage Caching\r\n- Implement Compression\r\n- Leverage NGINX API to Dynamically Configure servers at runtime\r\n- Install NGINX from binary & from source files\r\n\r\n**Audience**\r\nNGINX Core is intended for admins, architects, and DevOps professionals who are self-taught or new to NGINX. NGINX Core will expose you to core functionality through lecture, demonstration, and hands-on labs.\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nNo prior knowledge or experience with NGINX is required. Participants should have a basic understanding of web servers and a basic understanding of the Unix command line. Required skills include running Unix commands, navigating the file system, and creating and editing text files.","speakers":[{"_id":"59764b33940a8daa4e0002a2","full_name":"Bob Worobec","first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Worobec","company":"NGINX, Inc.","job_title":"Training Manager","headline":"Training Manager at NGINX, Inc.","location":null,"url":null,"twitter_username":"nginx","created_at":"2017-07-24T12:32:03-07:00","updated_at":"2017-07-27T13:24:44-07:00","bio":"Bob Worobec is Training Manager at NGINX.
