This results in inefficiencies and unnecessary costs in bandwidth and server specifications. With device awareness now available at the server layer, administrators are directly empowered to provide the ability to handle different device traffic in a highly efficient and scalable way for their organizations.\r\n\r\nAfilias Technologies CTO, Ronan Cremin, will share a case study with real world results achieved by deploying an NGINX module for device awareness for a network of hundreds of thousands of sites, bringing significant benefits not only in infrastructure cost reductions, but also in improved UX and performance for site visitors.

This allows us to regularly perform zero-downtime failovers between data centres, as well as allow for fine-grained resource isolation.

When new code is released and applications nodes ready, Nginx is alerted and directs traffic to new pools serving the latest release. Using a header to tag requests with the current release Nginx will continue to direct the request to the correct release while it makes it way through the stack, ensuring that each request will hit the appropriate application version during and after the traffic switch.","location_override":null,"category":null,"category_name":null,"created_at":"2015-07-02T14:38:06-07:00","updated_at":"2015-07-30T14:01:42-07:00","speakers":[{"_id":"5595af3e64bb104021000056","full_name":"Derek DeJonghe","first_name":"Derek","last_name":"DeJonghe","company":"RightBrain Networks","job_title":"Cloud Systems Architect","headline":"Cloud Systems Architect at RightBrain Networks","bio":"Cloud System Architect, working for RightBrain Networks.

Today there are two standard approaches to resume a TLS session: via a session ticket or via session ID. Both approaches come with their own complexities. Session ticket resumption, by default, does not guarantee forward secrecy--meaning the same ticket key will be reused without rotation. Meanwhile, there are still a large portion of web clients that don\u2019t support session ticket resumption. The session ID approach requires synchronized caching of session data between hosts, which isn\u2019t possible today with the NGINX code base. Supporting both--not one over the other--is the  the best approach to enabling TLS cross-host session resumption. CloudFlare\u2019s Zi Lin will share a new way to completely enable TLS resumption without doubling efforts.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover how forward secrecy can be easily implemented through new directives in ngx_lua without needing to do complex rewrite of nginx source code.

The front end is only one part of the performance puzzle and to really understand performance you need a more comprehensive view. The challenge is that data such as logs, metrics and events are typically silo'd by the various tools used to manage each.  However unifying all that data in one analytics platform can provide that end-to-end correlation. Once data is unified, users can instantly see the affect of a code deploy on system performance or application error codes or even user signup rates. Making use of all that unified data also requires a platform flexible enough to handle all the various workflows. In this talk, I will cover how we have solved these challenges.","location_override":null,"category":null,"category_name":null,"created_at":"2015-07-02T16:11:48-07:00","updated_at":"2015-09-02T13:39:59-07:00","speakers":[{"_id":"5595c534a21d6144e9000076","full_name":"Mike Demmer","first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Demmer","company":"Jut","job_title":"Co-Founder","headline":"Co-Founder at Jut","bio":"Mike is a co-founder and runs engineering as well as ops at Jut.

But rather than blindly picking the familiar or the fashionable, it's important to remember what Fred Books said almost 30 years ago: there are no silver bullets in software. Every architectural decision has both benefits and drawbacks. Whether the benefits of one approach outweigh the drawbacks greatly depends upon the context of your particular project. Moreover, even if you adopt the microservices architecture, you must still make numerous other design decisions, each with their own trade-offs. \r\n\r\nA software pattern is an ideal way of describing a solution to a problem in a given context along with its tradeoffs. In this presentation, we describe a pattern language for microservices. You will learn about patterns that will help you decide when and how to use microservices vs. a monolithic architecture. We will also describe patterns that solve various problems in a microservice architecture including inter-service communication, service registration and service discovery.","location_override":null,"category":null,"category_name":null,"created_at":"2015-06-29T17:09:05-07:00","updated_at":"2015-08-11T08:32:03-07:00","speakers":[{"_id":"5591de212f3c6026a0000003","full_name":"Chris Richardson","first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Richardson","company":null,"job_title":null,"headline":null,"bio":"Chris Richardson is a developer and architect.

This started a few years ago with the Netflix ( one of the largest NGINX customers) \"Building with Legos\" approach where they created an immutable infrastructure pipeline for service delivery. Continuos Delivery (CD) has been all the rage over the past few years; but, now organizations are making clever usage of containerization to make the complete delivery pipeline immutable (\"Immutable\" delivery\"). First off, the delivery pipeline is all containerized components with some teams doing containers-in-containers (this is also referred to as DinD - Docker in Docker) for build slaves. Furthermore using binary artifacts (container images) developers can push full service stacks throughout the CD pipeline knowing that the stack is immutable at every step of the process. If the process is \"green\" through the flow then the dev org knows that the base OS, middleware and application are bit for bit identical. Docker and a few organizations like Yelp, Capital One and Gilt we be discussed as model examples of companies that are delivering service in an immutable fashion.","location_override":null,"category":2,"category_name":"keynote","created_at":"2015-08-03T10:45:24-07:00","updated_at":"2015-08-14T13:45:30-07:00","speakers":[{"_id":"55bfa8b4e6bdb24c36000105","full_name":"John Willis","first_name":"John","last_name":"Willis","company":"Docker","job_title":"Director of Ecosystem Development","headline":"Director of Ecosystem Development at Docker","bio":"John Willis has worked in the IT management industry for more than 35 years.
